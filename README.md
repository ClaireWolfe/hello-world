# hello-world
A place to test new things, and store ideas and resources

I am learning GitHub so that I can use it for the ICDC project.  I work with the data model and transform input data for loading into the project.  The data model uses a graph db.  This is new to me, so I am learning how to view the schema and request changes to the model that will be done via GitHub.  We will also be storing the transformation files on GitHub, so that we can keep track of different versions for each transformation.

I am trying to figure out how to connect GitHub and Jira using DVCS.  Wish me luck, because I don't have a clue what I am doing.
